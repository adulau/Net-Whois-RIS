    Function to get prefixes announced per ASN added

    Expecting to see a way to get the information per ASN
    via the RIS whois protocol, I discovered this not the case.
    As the RIPE RIS dashboard is providing the information,
    the function is relying on the Ajax interface to gather the data.
    I hope this is an acceptable use of the Ajax interface for RIPE RIS.
    Maybe RIPE RIS will decide to add the ability to query an ASN
    directly via the RIS whois later on. The Scrappy perl module is required
    if you intend to use the function.
